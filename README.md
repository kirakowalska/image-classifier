# image-classifier
Basic hand-written digit and letter classifier using CNN (convolutional neural networks) implemented in Tensorflow.

## Performance
Training accuracy: 96.9%

Validation accuracy: 96.9%

Validation accuracy is the expected accuracy of the classifier on unseen data. It is estimated by running the classifier on 20% of data that was withheld from training.

## Technologies used: 
* TensorFlow for deep learning 
* Numpy, Sci-kit for numerical manipulations
* Imgaug for image augmentation
